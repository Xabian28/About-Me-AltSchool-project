                <h1> EARLY LIFE AND EDUCATION: </h1>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in the outskirt of Ajegunle, a small city that has gotten so many prejudices due to the way of life of Ajegunle habitants. I grew up in a family of 9, the 6th child of 7. Life wasn't good for us but we were <br> better than
                    many families. I have always been a bright student from my early education to my secondary, though not the best amongst my peers but always making sure i hang far far above average. <br><br>
            
                    Growing up, i always wondered what life would look like if my parents were a little comfortable in providing basic necessities. I have never failed any exams in my life but wonder, how come i don't get admission even after passing
                    Jamb and Post-Utme four times, ( i guess life just happens ) 
            
                    I have laid my hands on so many things just to make sure i secure a better future, but i keep going in circles. <br><br> My Life as a whole can easily be described as Trial by Error.
            
                    In recent years, i have seen people online talk about tech and the many opportunities but i never knew the right path or platform to point me in the direction. As a <br> boy from a very poor background, all i ever want is to get my hands on
                    every opportunity (legally) to lift my family from the shackles of poverty. I was curious about how tech works, which led me to pursue a degree in <br> Software Engineering at AltSchool Africa when i saw the opportunity.

                <h1> CAREER AND ACHIEVEMENTS: </h1>
                <p>
                    The main reason i joined AltSchool Africa is because, i see AltSchool Africa as a bridge for me and my career in becoming a certified Cloud Engineer which is my biggest goal in this journey i have embarked on.

                <h1> PERSONAL LIFE: </h1>
                <p>
                    Outside of learning, i enjoy taking solo walks, playing Fifa games, chilling and burning time with family and friends, and reading price actions. Helping people in the best way i can, and living Life in solitude. My family and friends are important to me, and we often spend time together.

                <h1> LATER LIFE AND FUTURE GOALS: </h1>
                <p>
                    Like i said, i am currently a student of AltSchool Africa studying Software Engineering, in the Cloud Engineering track. I will be focusing on advancing my skills in becoming AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner. <br><br>
                    My goal is to create technology that not only solves problems but also makes a positive impact on the World.

                <p>
                    Looking back, my journey has been filled and will always be filled with challenges and triumphs that have shaped who i am today and continue to shape me into the person i will become. I believe in the power of technology <br><br> 
                    to transform lives, and i am excited about the future and the opportunities to continue making a difference.

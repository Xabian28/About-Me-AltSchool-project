            <h2> From Crumb To The Cloud: My Journey into Technology </h2> <br>
            <p> " If you'd told me two years ago that i'd be on the path to becoming a Cloud Engineer, i probably would've laughed it off. I didn't even know what "cloud computing" meant, let alone imagine <br> it would become such a big part of my life.
                But here i am, deep in the world of tech, and loving every minute of it.
            </p> <br>
        
            <p> Hi! My name is Osolease Ikhuoria Daniel, a passionate individual with a love for technology and innovation. Growing up in Nigeria, i was always the person friends and family came to when
                <br> their phones acted up. It started as a hobby to just fix things
                here and there, taking apart gadgets to see how they worked. I wouldn't say i loved the challenge of problems, but i never thought it would lead to a career. Back then i didn't see technology as more than just a way to help out my friends and family.
                <br><br>
        
                As i got older, though, i began to feel like there was more out there for me. I wanted to do something bigger, something that could really make a difference. That's when i started looking into different fields in tech. I knew i didn't like involving in 
                problems solving that much, but i wanted to go beyond that. I wanted to be part of something that was shaping the future.
                
                <br><br>
        
                One day, i stumbled upon cloud computing. At first, it was just a buzzword to me, something that didn't make much sense to me. But the more i read about it, the more intrigued i became. The <br> idea of moving everything to the cloud, making technology accessible
                to anyone, and anywhere , just clicked with me. It felt like the future i wanted to take a part in.
                <br><br>
        
                But let me tell you, getting started wasn't easy. Diving into tech felt like jumping into the deep end without knowing how to swim. There were so many new terms and concepts to learn. I spent <br> a lot of late nights watching Youtube tutorials, taking online 
                classes and reading everything and anything i could get on the internet, trying to make sense of it all.
                <br><br>
        
                As i continued learning, i decided to get serious about tech (Cloud Engineering to be precise). The Universe fell on my laps when i got a fully funded schorlarship from the WDA Foundation, <br>
                after passing my entrance exams, and this marks the beginning of my tech journey.

                I wanted to go into Front End Engineering, then i discovered how clustered the field has become for me so my interest in Cloud Engineering sparked when i realized the incredible potential. <br> The moment i got a little understanding of how cloud computing could 
                eliminate the need for expensive hardware and make technology accessible to everyone, i was blown. The counter- <br> balancing of tech through cloud and  the idea of managing and optimizing Cloud infrastructures to ensure the seamless, scalable solutions intrigued me.

            <p> 
                <b> Short-term Goals: </b> In the coming months, i plan to dive deeper into the full concepts, as well as explore advanced topics like Cloud Security and Optimization. 
                I am eagerly elated to see what AltSchool has planned for me in the coming semester. Upon graduation from AltSchool, my next target will be the Google Professional Cloud Architect certification.
                <br><br>
        
                <b> Long-term Goals:</b> Ultimately, i see myself as a Cloud solutions Architect, designing scalable, secure, and efficient cloud infrastructures for organizations. I aim to contribute to projects that leverage cloud technology
                to drive innovation and solve critical challenges. Also, designing solutions that help businesses grow and thrive in the digital world. I want to also work on projects <br> that make a real impact, not just on a technical level, but on a human one.

            <h2> Closing Thought: </h2><br>
    
            <p> Reflecting on my journey so far, i am proud of how far i am willing to go. I will be transitioning from being a guy who just fascinated about stuffs to someone who's building and securing <br> Cloud environments. It's going to be a lot of hard work i know,
                but it will be incredibly rewarding at the end of it all.
                <br><br>
        
                To anyone out there who is thinking about getting into tech, my advice is simple: just start. Take it one step at a time, be patient with yourself, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. You don't <br> need to know everything right away. Just keep learning,
                keep practicing, and keep pushing forward.
                <br><br>
        
                The Cloud is the future and i'm glad i'm deciding to be a part of the moving train. Everyday brings new challenges and opportunities to grow, and that's what makes this journey so exciting. <br> I'm ready to keep learning, keep practicing, keep growing, and 
                keep helping others along the way.
